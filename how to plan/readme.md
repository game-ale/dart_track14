1. Understand the Feature
Before touching code:

Define exactly what the feature ***should do***.

***Identify inputs*** (data coming from the user or external systems).

***Identify outputs*** (UI changes, API calls, local storage updates).

Decide where it belongs in the architecture.

2. Map It to Clean Architecture Layers
A typical Clean Architecture stack has:

Domain Layer → Pure business rules

Entities (core models without framework dependencies)

Use Cases (application-specific business logic)

Data Layer → Data sources & repositories

Repository interfaces (declared in domain)

Repository implementations (fetching from API/local DB)

Mappers (convert raw data → entities and vice versa)

Presentation Layer → UI & state management

Bloc/ViewModel/Controller

Widgets/Pages



***Integration Order***
When adding a new feature, build in this order:

Domain (entities, contracts, use cases)

Data (implement repos + data sources)

Presentation (state mgmt + UI)

Wire them up in ***dependency injection*** (e.g., get_it in Flutter)


how do you take an ***implicit scenario*** (a vague feature request) and figure out:

## here we need two point

1) What’s really **being **asked**

2) What the entities should be


1️⃣ Extract the Real Scenario
If the request is vague like:

“We need a product search feature”

You don’t assume you know what that means.

You dig deeper:

***what you should check***

```
Who’s using it? (User roles)

What triggers it? (Events)

What is the main goal? (Outcome)

What should happen if it fails? (Fallback behavior)
```

💡 Tip: Think like a detective, not a coder. Ask why until the business rule is clear. **OK**

Example refined scenario:

```
Actor: Customer

Trigger: Types text into search bar

Goal: Finds relevant products quickly

Constraints: Show up to 20 results, sorted by relevance

Edge cases: No results → show recommendations

```

2️⃣ Identify Core Concepts
From the refined scenario, **list nouns** — they ***usually hint at entities:***

Product

Customer

SearchQuery

Recommendation

Also list verbs — they usually hint at use cases:

Search

Filter

Sort

Recommend

3️⃣ Decide What’s an Entity vs. a Value Object

***Entities*** = have a unique identity and lifecycle in the domain.

Example: Product (id, name, price, etc.)

***Value Objects*** = describe something but are interchangeable if data is same.

Example: SearchQuery (just a string, no identity)

Rule of thumb:

If you’d track it across time or updates → ***it’s an entity.***

If it’s just data for now → it’s a ***value object.***

4️⃣ Don’t Force the UI into Your Entities
***N.B The entity definition should not depend on how you’ll display it.***
For example:

Bad: Product { name, price, imageUrl, isExpanded } ← isExpanded is purely UI state.

Good: Product { id, name, price, description } — UI decides how to display.

5️⃣ Example: Turning Scenario → Entities
Scenario:

```
“A farmer wants to upload coffee quality data so buyers can see it and track it via blockchain.”

Step 1: Refine
Actor: Farmer

Action: Upload coffee batch data (moisture %, size, origin)

Goal: Make batch visible to buyers

Constraint: Data must be immutable once recorded

Step 2: Nouns → Candidate Entities
Farmer

CoffeeBatch

QualityReport

Buyer

Step 3: Decide Entities
Farmer (has ID, name, farm location)

CoffeeBatch (ID, harvest date, origin)

QualityReport (linked to CoffeeBatch, moisture %, defects, etc.)

Buyer (ID, name, contact)

```
