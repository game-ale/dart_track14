```
What Entities really are (and what they‚Äôre not)

Where Entities live in the architecture

How they flow through your project

Common mistakes & misunderstandings

Best practices so you don‚Äôt trap yourself later

```

1Ô∏è‚É£ What Entities Really Are
In Clean Architecture, Entities are:

```
The core business objects of your application

Framework-agnostic (no Flutter widgets, no database annotations, no HTTP code)

Stable (rarely change even if you replace the UI, DB, or API)

```


***They‚Äôre used in:***

```
Use Cases (input/output types)

Repositories (contracts)

State classes (in presentation layer ‚Äî but only passed through, not modified here)

Mapper conversions (from DTOs in data to Entities in domain)

```

3Ô∏è‚É£ How Entities Flow Through the Project


```
User searches for products (UI triggers SearchProductsUseCase)

Use Case calls ProductRepository.searchProducts(query)

Repository returns Entities, not API models

UI (Bloc/ViewModel) receives Entities and builds widgets

```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Common Misunderstandings


‚ùå ***Mistake 2: Adding UI State into Entities***

Entities are domain-only.
Bad:

```
class Product {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final bool isFavorite; // UI thing
}

```
### NB

```
class Product { ... } // no UI stuff


class ProductUI {
  final Product product;
  final bool isFavorite;
}

```
‚ùå Mistake 3: ***Returning Raw API Models in Use Cases***

If your usecase returns **ProductModel from data/models**,

you‚Äôve leaked the data layer into your domain/presentation ‚Äî bad for testability & maintainability.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Best Practices

‚úÖ 1. Entities are shared safely across layers

Yes ‚Äî you can use the same entity in:  ***OK***

Use Cases

Repositories

Bloc/ViewModels

Even widget parameters

Because they‚Äôre pure data, they won‚Äôt cause coupling problems.

***pretty nice***

‚úÖ 2. Entities should outlive your current tech stack
If tomorrow:

You switch from REST ‚Üí GraphQL

Or Hive ‚Üí SQLite

Or Flutter ‚Üí React Native

Your entities should stay the same.

***Dont forget***

‚úÖ 3. Use mappers to protect them
Example mapper:

```
extension ProductMapper on ProductModel {
  Product toEntity() {
    return Product(
      id: id,
      name: name,
      price: price,
      description: description,
    );
  }
}

```
*** Dont forget this one also ***

‚úÖ 4. Use ***immutable*** entities

Make all fields final

***Avoid setters**

Changes ‚Üí create a new entity instance

üí° In short:

Entities are the contract of your domain.

They can be used anywhere (use cases, repos, UI) but are owned by the domain layer.

Treat them like ***VIP guests***: clean, untouched, and respected.
