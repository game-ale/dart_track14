PHASE 1 — CONCEPTS
1. Whatness — What is Use Case Testing?
In Clean Architecture, the use case (or interactor) is the application-specific business rule.
It contains pure logic and no framework dependencies.
Testing it means verifying:

It calls the right repository methods with correct parameters.

It handles success, empty, and error cases properly.

It transforms repository data into the domain model correctly.

2. Whyness — Why Test Use Cases?
Catch business rule regressions early — before UI or API break.

Fast feedback — use cases are small and test quickly.

100% offline tests — no DB, API, or UI required.

Documentation — test names become living docs for expected behavior.

3. Whenness — When to Test

Always before integrating with ***UI*** — so you know logic is solid.

Whenever business rules change — like pricing, validation, filtering.

Before refactoring — to ensure behavior stays the same.


5. Test Types for Use Cases

|Test Type	               | Purpose                                               |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|Unit Test	               | Main type — verifies the use case logic in isolation. |
|Mocked Integration Test   | Tests use case + repo (mocked API) together.          |
|Property-Based Test	   | Ensures use case works for a wide range of inputs.    |


6. Dependencies in Testing
You’ll usually mock dependencies like repositories.
Common Dart/Flutter mocking tools:

***mocktail (modern, recommended)***

mockito (older, but still used)

***fake classes *** (handwritten for small projects)

7. Common Scenarios to Cover

When testing a use case, cover:

```
Happy Path — repository returns expected data.

Empty Data — repository returns empty result.

Failure/Error — repository throws an exception or returns failure type.

Parameter Validation — what if input params are invalid.

Edge Cases — extreme values, boundaries.

```

8. Common Mistakes

❌ Testing repository logic inside use case test — repo has its own tests.
❌ Skipping error scenarios — production errors will slip through.
❌ Not using mocks — leads to slow, flaky tests.
❌ Too many mocks — mocking everything blindly makes tests brittle.
❌ No meaningful names — test("test1") is useless.

9. Golden Rules
1 use case = 1 dedicated test file.

Test names should read like English sentences.

Always test both success and failure.

Use arrange–act–assert structure.




Covers all scenarios:

✅ Success case

✅ Failure case

✅ Invalid input

✅ Exception handling

Clean arrange–act–assert structure → easy to read and maintain.

No unnecessary test coupling → repository logic is tested elsewhere.

Verifies interactions → ensures correct repository method calls.

Pro Tips for Scaling Use Case Tests
Create a test_util.dart file to store sample data for multiple test files.

Use setUpAll instead of setUp if your mocks/data don’t change between tests.

Group tests with group() by scenario to keep files organized.

Keep test names as sentences → they become living documentation.
