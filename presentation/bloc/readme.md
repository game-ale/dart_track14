1️⃣ What is BLoC?
BLoC = Business Logic Component
It’s a design pattern that:

Separates business logic from UI

Uses Streams to handle asynchronous events

Ensures UI is reactive — rebuilds automatically on state change

In Flutter Clean Architecture:

UI layer (widgets) → sends Events to BLoC

BLoC → processes events using Use Cases from the domain layer

BLoC → emits States back to UI

2️⃣ Why BLoC in Clean Architecture

``
Testability → UI and logic are separate

Reusability → Logic can be shared across multiple screens

Predictability → Strict event → state flow, no spaghetti updates

Scalability → Works well with small or large apps

```

4️⃣ Core BLoC Flow

```

UI triggers Event → bloc.add(LoadProductsEvent())

BLoC receives Event → calls corresponding Use Case

Use Case fetches data via Repository

Repository → fetches from Remote/Local Data Source

BLoC emits new State → UI rebuilds

```

5️⃣ Key Principles

```

Single Responsibility → One BLoC per feature (e.g., ProductBloc)

Immutable States → Every state is a new object

Event-driven → Never call methods directly, always add(Event)

Error Handling in States → Don't throw exceptions to UI, emit ErrorState

Close Streams → Always dispose Bloc if manually created

```

6️⃣ Common Mistakes

```
❌ Putting API calls inside BLoC → Should use Use Cases instead

❌ Making states mutable → Will break rebuilds and cause bugs

❌ One giant BLoC for the whole app → Hard to maintain

❌ Too much logic in UI → Keep logic inside BLoC, not Widgets

❌ No loading state → Always represent loading explicitly in 

```


8️⃣ Tips for Real Projects
Keep events simple and descriptive.

Use Equatable to optimize rebuilds.

Avoid “God BLoCs” — split by feature.

Use Freezed if you want sealed classes for cleaner states/events.

Write unit tests for BLoC to avoid UI bugs.
